### ðŸš€ Features
- Stress Prediction: Utilizes machine learning (Random Forest) to analyze student stress levels based on various factors.
- Interactive Dashboard: Provides real-time data visualization of stress trends, triggers, and personalized recommendations.
- Notification System: Alerts students and parents when stress levels are critically high.
- Wellness Recommendations: Offers suggestions like mindfulness exercises, physical activities, and screen time management.
- Explainable AI (XAI): Uses SHAP analysis to interpret the most influential features impacting stress.
- Gamification: Encourages engagement through achievements and wellness tracking.

### ðŸ›  Methodology
- Dataset: The Kaggle Student Stress Dataset containing 20+ features grouped into:
  - Psychological (e.g., anxiety_level, mental_health_history)
  - Physiological (e.g., blood_pressure, sleep_quality)
  - Environmental (e.g., noise_level, living_conditions)
  - Academic (e.g., study_load, future_career_concerns)
  - Social (e.g., peer_pressure, social_support)

- Machine Learning Models:
  - Feature selection using ANOVA & Chi-Square Test.
  - Stress prediction using Decision Tree and Random Forest Regressor (RÂ² = 0.82).
  - SHAP Analysis: Identifies key factors influencing stress levels.

- System Components
  - Sensors (Future Scope): Blood pressure monitors, PIR motion sensors, and emotion recognition via cameras.
  - Database: SQLite3 for storing real-time stress data.
  - Dashboard: Displays monthly stress trends, productivity insights, and stress triggers.

### ðŸŽ¯ Use Cases
- Students: Monitor stress levels before exams, presentations, and daily routines.
- Parents: Get insights into student well-being and establish healthier habits.
- Educators (Future Scope): View anonymized student stress trends for proactive intervention.

### ðŸ”® Challenges & Future Scope
- Sensor Integration: Expanding real-time monitoring using wearables and environmental sensors.
- Personalized AI Recommendations: Stress history-based suggestions.
- Mobile Application: Extending accessibility beyond web platforms.
- Teacher Dashboard: Institutional-level intervention planning.
